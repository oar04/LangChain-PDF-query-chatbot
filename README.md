   This has already been pre-populated with relavent documents

3. **Configure your Pinecone API key.**
   You can obtain your API key by signing up for Pinecone at https://www.pinecone.io/.

4. **Configure your OpenAI API key.**
   You can obtain your API key by signing up for OpenAI at https://openai.com/product.

5. **Add the keys and other relavent details into env.py**

6. **Run the script to process the PDFs and store them in Pinecone:**
   python injest_text.py

7. **Run the script to start the chat:**
   python main.py

The chatbot will prompt you for commands and respond to your queries based on the content of the processed PDFs.
You can interact with the chatbot to retrieve information from the PDF documents and ask questions related to climate control topics.
